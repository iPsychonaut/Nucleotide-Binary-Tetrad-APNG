# Nucleotide-Binary-Tetrad-APNG
An application of my Binary Tetrad Encoding to convert a given image, .fna FASTA file, and encode the chromomes into images and then create an animated .png (.apng) that cycles through the organism's chromosomes. The code also contains functions for decoding and quality control checks as well.
